@par Example Description

This example shows how to use EEPROM.
- Erase main memory page 5
- Word programm main memory page 5
- Erase information memory page 0
- Word programm information memory page 0

@par Directory "Examples/MDR1986VE1T" contains:

  - MDR32F9Qx_config.h                   Library Configuration file
  - MDR32F9Qx_board.h                    Evaluation board Configuration file
  - EEPROM/Sector_Operations/main.c      Main program

@par Hardware and Software environment:

  - This example is intended to run on MDR1986VE1T eval board with MDR1986VE1TT1 microcontroller.
  - VD7 (LED0), VD8 (LED1), VD9 (LED2) are connected to PD.7, PD.8, PD.9 pins, respectively.

@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
  - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
  - Add main.c file.
  - Add the required files from "Library" folder:
        MDR32F9Qx_port.c
        MDR32F9Qx_rst_clk.c
        MDR32F9Qx_eeprom.c
  - Edit the MDR32F9Qx_conf.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
  - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
  - Run the example.
