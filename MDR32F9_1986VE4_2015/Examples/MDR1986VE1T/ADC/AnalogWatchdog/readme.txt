@par Example Description

This example describes how to use the ADC analog watchdog to guard continuously
an ADC channel. The ADC1 is configured to convert continuously ADC channel 2.
The analog watchdog is configured and enabled to guard a single regular channel.
Each time the channel 2 converted value exceed programmed analog watchdog high
threshold (value 0x0900) or goes down analog watchdog low threshold (value 0x0800)
an AWD interrupt is generated and the output pin connected to LED1 is turn on.
The LED3 will bright as long as the AWD interrupt is generated which means
that the converted value of regular ADC channel 2 is outside the range limited 
by high and low analog watchdog thresholds.
The LED4 will bright as long as the converted value of regular ADC channel 2 is  above the upper limit.
Regular ADC channel 2 connected to the trim resistor.

  - ADC/Analog_Watchdog/main.c                Main program
  - ADC/Analog_Watchdog/MDR1986VE1T_IT.c      Main Interrupt Service Routines
  - ADC/Analog_Watchdog/MDR1986VE1T_IT.h      Functions prototypes for the interrupt

@par Hardware and Software environment:

  - This example is intended to run on MDR1986VE1T eval board with 
  	MDR1986VE1T microcontroller.
  - XP5 jamper must be switched to the R14.
  - VD8 jamper must be disable.
  - VD9 and VD10 jampers must be enable.

@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
  - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
  - Add main.c file.
  - Add the required files from "Libraries" folder:
        MDR32F9Qx_port.c
        MDR32F9Qx_rst_clk.c
	    MDR32F9Qx_adc.c
	    MDR32F9Qx_uart.c
  - Edit the MDR32F9Qx_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
  - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
  - Run the example.
