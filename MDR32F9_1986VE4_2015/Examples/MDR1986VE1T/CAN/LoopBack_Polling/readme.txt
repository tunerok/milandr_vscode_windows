@par Example Description

This example provides a description of how to set a communication with the CAN in loopback mode.
The CAN1 cell performs a transmission and a reception of a extended data frame by polling at 125 Kbits/s.
The received frame is checked and LED1 light up to indicate what the communication was successful, else LED2 light up.

@par Hardware and Software environment:

  - This example is intended to run on MDR1986VE1T eval board with MDR1986VE1T microcontroller.

@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
  - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
  - Add main.c file.
  - Add the required files from "Libraries" folder:
        MDR32F9Qx_port.c
        MDR32F9Qx_rst_clk.c
	      MDR32F9Qx_can.c
  - Edit the MDR32F9Qx_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
  - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
  - Run the example.
