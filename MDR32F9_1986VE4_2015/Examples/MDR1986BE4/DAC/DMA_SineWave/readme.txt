@par Example Description

This example describes how to use DAC with DMA to generate sine waves on DAC channel output.
Configure PORTA line 5 as DAC1_OUT .
DMA channel10 is configured to transfer ping-pong mode, word by word, a 32-word 
buffer to DAC register DAC1_DATA. The transfered 32 buffer is made to have 
a sine wave generation on DAC channel output. DAC channel1 is enabled. Once TIM1
is enabled, each TIM1 CNT_ARR_EVENT generate a DMA request which transfer data
to the  DAC DATA register and DAC conversion is started. The sine waves can be
visualized by connecting DAC_OUT to an oscilloscope.

@par Hardware and Software environment:

  - This example is intended to run on MDR1986BE4 eval board with MDR1986BE4 microcontroller.

@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
  - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
  - Add main.c file.
  - Add MDR32F9Qx_it.c and MDR32F9Qx_it.h files.
  - Add the required files from "Libraries" folder:
        MDR32F9Qx_port.c
        MDR32F9Qx_rst_clk.c
	    MDR32F9Qx_dac.c
	    MDR32F9Qx_timer.c
	    MDR32F9Qx_dma.c
  - Edit the MDR32F9Qx_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
  - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
  - Run the example.
