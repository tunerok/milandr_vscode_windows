@par Example Description

This example describes how to use the ADC1 and DMA to transfer continuously
converted data from ADC1 to memory. The ADC1 is configured to converts 
continuously ADC channel31 - Temperature Sensor. Each time an end of conversion
occurs the DMA transfers, in ping-pong mode, the converted data from ADC1 RESULT
register to the ADC_ConvertedValue[10] array of variables.

@par Hardware and Software environment:

  - This example is intended to run on MDR1986BE4 eval board with MDR1986BE4 microcontroller.

@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
  - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
  - Add main.c file.
  - Add MDR32F9Qx_it.c and MDR32F9Qx_it.h files.
  - Add the required files from "Libraries" folder:
        MDR32F9Qx_port.c
        MDR32F9Qx_rst_clk.c
	      MDR32F9Qx_adc.c
	      MDR32F9Qx_dma.c
  - Edit the MDR32F9Qx_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
  - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
  - Run the example.
