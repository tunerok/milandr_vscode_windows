@par Example Description

This example describes how to use the ADC analog watchdog to guard continuously
an ADC channel. The ADC1 is configured to convert continuously ADC channel 2.
The analog watchdog is configured and enabled to guard a single regular channel.
Each time the channel 2 converted value exceed programmed analog watchdog high
threshold (value 0x0900) or goes down analog watchdog low threshold (value 0x0800)
an AWD interrupt is generated and the output pin connected to LED1 is turn on.
The LED1 will bright as long as the AWD interrupt is generated which means
that the converted value of regular ADC channel 2 is outside the range limited by high
and low analog watchdog thresholds.
The LED2 will bright as long as the converted value of regular ADC channel 2 is  above the upper limit.
Regular ADC channel 2 connected to the trim resistor.

@par Hardware and Software environment:

  - This example is intended to run on MDR32F9Q3 eval board with MDR32F9Q3 microcontroller.
  - ADC_INP_SEL jamper must be switched into a state TRIM.

@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
  - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
  - Add main.c file.
  - Add the required files from "Libraries" folder:
        MDR32F9Qx_port.c
        MDR32F9Qx_rst_clk.c
	      MDR32F9Qx_adc.c
  - Edit the MDR32F9Qx_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
  - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
  - Run the example.
