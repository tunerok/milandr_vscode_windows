@par Example Description

  This example provides a description of how to use DMA with TIM1 Capture request to transfer Data
  from TIM1 Capture Compare Register2 to memory.
  The TIM1 Channel1 is configured to generate one pulse when TIM_CNT = CCR1.
  TIM1 channel2 is configured to capture events. CCR2 register value transfered to memory using DMA request.
  Once the transfer is completed a comparison is done and TransferStatus gives the data transfer status
  where it is PASSED if CCR1 register value and transmitted data are the same otherwise it is FAILED.

@par Directory "Examples/MDR32F9Q2_EVAL" contains:

  - MDR32F9Qx_config.h            Library Configuration file
  - MDR32F9Qx_board.h             Evaluation board Configuration file
  - DMA/TIMER_RAM/main.c          Main program

@par Hardware and Software environment:

  - This example is intended to run on MDR32F9Q2 eval board with MDR32F9Q2 microcontroller.
  - Connect TIMER1 CH1 pin (X27.1.12) to TIMER1 CH2 pin (X27.1.10).

@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
  - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
  - Add main.c file.
  - Add the required files from "Libraries" folder:
        MDR32F9Qx_port.c
        MDR32F9Qx_rst_clk.c
	      MDR32F9Qx_timer.c
	      MDR32F9Qx_dma.c
  - Edit the MDR32F9Qx_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
  - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
  - Run the example.
