@par Example Description

This example shows how to use RST_CLK module functions to choose particular
CPU_CLK frequency. That action includes the following steps:
- RST_CLK module deinitialization;
- RST_CLK module initialization;
- - enable PORTC clock;
- - enable BKP clock;
- RST_CLK module initialization;
- Set CPU_CLK = HSI clock and blink with LED1 using this clock;
- Set CPU_CLK = HSI/2 clock and blink with LED1 using this clock;
- Set CPU_CLK = 7*HSE/2 clock and blink with LED1 using this clock;
- Set CPU_CLK = LSI clock and blink with LED1 using this clock;

LED1 - for new frequensy setting up indication;
LED2 - for frequensy setting error;

@par Directory "Examples/MDR32F9Q2_EVAL" contains:

  - MDR32F9Qx_config.h                 Library Configuration file
  - MDR32F9Qx_board.h                  Evaluation board Configuration file
  - RST_CLK/CPU_Clock/main.c           Main program

@par Hardware and Software environment:

  - This example is intended to run on MDR32F9Q1 eval board with MDR32F9Q1 microcontroller.
  - VD3 (LED1), VD4 (LED2) are connected to PC.0, PC.1 pins, respectively.

@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
  - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
  - Add main.c file.
  - Add the required files from "Libraries" folder:
        MDR32F9Qx_port.c
        MDR32F9Qx_rst_clk.c
  - Edit the MDR32F9Qx_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
  - Edit the main.c to set appropriate LEDs blink count and rate.
  - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
  - Run the example.
