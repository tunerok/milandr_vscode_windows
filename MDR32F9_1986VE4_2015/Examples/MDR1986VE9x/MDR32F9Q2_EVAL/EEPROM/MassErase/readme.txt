@par Directory "Examples/MDR32F9Q2_EVAL" contains:

  - MDR32F9Qx_config.h                   Library Configuration file
  - MDR32F9Qx_board.h                    Evaluation board Configuration file
  - EEPROM/MassErase/main.c              Main program

@par Hardware and Software environment:

  - This example is intended to run on MDR32F9Q2 eval board with MDR32F9Q2Y microcontroller.
  - VD3 (LED0), VD4 (LED1) are connected to PC.0, PC.1 pins, respectively.

@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
  - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
  - Add main.c file.
  - Add the required files from "Library" folder:
        MDR32F9Qx_port.c
        MDR32F9Qx_rst_clk.c
        MDR32F9Qx_eeprom.c
  - Edit the MDR32F9Qx_conf.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
  - To allocate all code in RAM edit appropriate linker options.
  - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
  - Run the example.
