@par Example Description

This example provides a description of how to use four DMA channels to transfer a data
buffer from memory to SPI_SLAVE(SSP4) through SPI_MASTER(SSP2) and a second data buffer
from memory to SPI_MASTER through SPI_SLAVE in full-duplex mode.
For each SSP DMA Tx/Rx requests are enabled.
In this example both transmission and reception are managed through DMA and the received
data are stored into buffers declared in the SRAM. The DMA channels involved in this
transfer depend on the used SPIs.
A polling on all Transfer complete flags are done for all used DMA channels to check the
end of all DMA channels transfers.
The transmitted and received buffers are compared to check that all data have been correctly
transferred.

@par Directory "Examples/MDR1986VE3" contains:

  - MDR32F9Qx_config.h            Library Configuration file
  - MDR32F9Qx_board.h             Evaluation board Configuration file
  - DMA/SPI_RAM/main.c            Main program

@par Hardware and Software environment:

  - This example is intended to run on MDR1986VE3 eval board with MDR1986VE3 microcontroller.
  - Connect SSP2 FSS (PC12) pin (XP26.8) to SSP4 FSS (PI11) pin (XP54.13).
  - Connect SSP2 CLK (PC11) pin (XP26.7) to SSP4 CLK (PI12) pin (XP54.14).
  - Connect SSP2 RXD (PC10) pin (XP26.6) to SSP4 TXD (PI13) pin (XP54.15).
  - Connect SSP2 TXD (PC9)  pin (XP26.5) to SSP4 RXD (PI14) pin (XP54.16).

@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
  - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
  - Add main.c file.
  - Add the required files from "Libraries" folder:
        MDR32F9Qx_port.c
        MDR32F9Qx_rst_clk.c
	      MDR32F9Qx_ssp.c
	      MDR32F9Qx_dma.c
  - Edit the MDR32F9Qx_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
  - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
  - Run the example.
