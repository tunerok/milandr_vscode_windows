@par Example Description

  This example shows how to configure the TIM4 peripheral to generate 5 PWM signals with 3 different duty cycles.
  TIM4CLK is fixed to 4 MHz, the TIM4 Prescaler is equal to 0 so the TIM4 counter clock used is 4 MHz.

  TIM4 frequency is defined as follow: TIM4 frequency = TIM4CLK/(TIM4_Period + 1) = 1.95 KHz

  The TIM4 CCR1 register value is equal to 0x7FF, so the TIM4 Channel 1 and TIM4 Channel 1N generate a PWM signal with a frequency equal to 1.95 KHz KHz and a duty cycle equal to: TIM4 Channel1 duty cycle = TIM4_CCR1 /( TIM4_Period + 1) = 50%.

  The TIM4 CCR2 register value is equal to 0x3FF, so the TIM4 Channel 2 and TIM4 Channel 2N generate a PWM signal with a frequency equal to 1.95 KHz KHz and a duty cycle equal to: TIM4 Channel2 duty cycle = TIM4_CCR2 / ( TIM4_Period + 1) = 25%.

  The TIM4 CCR3 register value is equal to 0x1FF, so the TIM4 Channel 3 generate a PWM signal with a frequency equal to 1.95 KHz KHz and a duty cycle equal to: TIM4 Channel3 duty cycle = TIM4_CCR3 / ( TIM4_Period + 1) = 12.5%.

  The TIM4 waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

@par Hardware and Software environment:

  - This example is intended to run on MDR1986VE3 eval board with MDR1986VE3 microcontroller;
@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
  - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
  - Add main.c file.
  - Add the required files from "Libraries" folder:
        MDR32F9Qx_port.c
        MDR32F9Qx_rst_clk.c
	      MDR32F9Qx_timer.c
  - Edit the MDR32F9Qx_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
  - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
  - Run the example.
